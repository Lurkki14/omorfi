That is, people who have helped but are not necessarily [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.html).

contributed by reporting problems, suggesting various improvements or
submitting actual code. Here is a list of these people. Help me keep it
complete and exempt of errors.

  by Inari Listenmaa in a B.A. thesis project.
