* _Plurale tantums, ngät stems, ngät : nkä  variations_
* Universal POS is NOUN and legacy POS is NOUN
* suffixes use front vowel harmony
* KOTUS paradigm used in their dictionary is 10-G
* The lemmas must end in * gät * (which will be deleted to form an invariant stub) and the regex matching the lemma is ` ngät `
* This is a [plurale tantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum) paradigm for plural only nominals.
