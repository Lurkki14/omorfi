* _Plurale tantums, rtaat stem, rtaat : ras variations_
* Universal POS is NOUN and legacy POS is NOUN
* suffixes use back vowel harmony
* KOTUS paradigm used in their dictionary is 41-K
* The lemmas must end in * taat * (which will be deleted to form an invariant stub) and the regex matching the lemma is ` rtaat `
* This is a [plurale tantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum) paradigm for plural only nominals.
