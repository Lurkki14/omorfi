### ` PROPN_LAHDET `

* _Plural-only proper nouns, det stem, det : ti variations_
* Universal POS is PROPN and legacy POS is NOUN
* suffixes use back vowel harmony
* KOTUS paradigm used in their dictionary is 7-F
* The lemmas must end in * det * (which will be deleted to form an invariant stub) and the regex matching the lemma is ` [AOUŌÓÅaouåôąáăâāóōúūû][^äöy]*det `
* This is a [plurale tantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum) paradigm for plural only nominals.
