# Lexemes

* ♂ for primarily male names
* ♀ for primarily female names
* 🧑² for surname of a person
* 🌍 for geographic location
* ⚐ for a country
* 💱 for currencies
* 📺 for media
* 🎶 for band or artists
* 🗪 for languages
* org for organisations
* 📏 for unit of measurement
* ⁈ for proper noun not suitable for other categories of proper nouns
