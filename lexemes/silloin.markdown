###  silloin

adposition is rare and I haven't found good examples after I started documenting these stuffs, so it may be deprecated and removed in future versions
* UPOS:  X
* Added from:  finer


## silloin (alternate reading 2 )

usually seen as adverb (then), but overlaps instructive of the noun *silta* (bridge)
* UPOS:  ADV
* Added from:  omorfi
